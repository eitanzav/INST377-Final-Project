# INST377-Final-Project

Title of your project: HappyTummy Explorer

Description of your project: We created a web application that helps individuals with food allergies discover safe and delicious recipes that align with their dietary restrictions. This application will leverage the spoonacular API, a comprehensive food API that provides detailed information about ingredients, recipes, and dietary considerations.

Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?): Our Food Allergy Recipe Finder Web Application is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across various platforms. The application is optimized for the latest versions of popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. We recommend users access the application using up-to-date versions of these browsers to ensure optimal performance, security, and access to all features.
